# Time-Series Crop Classification with Deep Learning

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook demonstrating time series classification for crop identification using deep learning techniques. The dataset used in this demonstration is a subset of the MiniTimeMatch dataset.

## Dataset Information

Each observation in the dataset consists of a time series of 62 observations taken across 10 spectral bands of Sentinel-2 for 19 different classes in France. Each observation corresponds to spectral measurements aggregated over a land parcel. The observations are labeled with the crop found in the parcel.
